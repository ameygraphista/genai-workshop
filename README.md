# GraphRAG Workshops

This repository contains two GraphRAG workshops: **Talent** and **Customers+Products**. Each workshop provides notebooks, data, and resources for hands-on exercises.

## Workshops


1. **[Talent](talent)**  
Combine both structured and unstructured data about employees and their technical skills into a knowledge graph. Perform graph pattern matching, vector search, and graph analytics to find similar skill sets and cohorts/clusters.  Use the knowledge graph to power a GraphRAG talent agent that can search and respond to inquiries about people, their skills, and their similarities.


2. **[Customers & Products](customers-and-products)**  
Uses real-world customer and product data from a fashion, style, and beauty retailer. Learn how to use a knowledge graph to ground an LLM with GraphRAG, enabling AI to build tailored marketing content personalized to each customer based on their interests and shared purchase histories. Learn about retrieval strategies leveraging vector search, graph pattern matching, and graph machine learning.


3. **[Financial Documents](financial_documents)**  
Learn how to ingest complex, unstructured financial documents (like 10-K filings) into a Neo4j knowledge graph. This workshop covers PDF parsing, data chunking, and building a GraphRAG pipeline to perform semantic search and answer complex questions about financial data and sets you up to understand GraphRAG across structured and unstructured data.
