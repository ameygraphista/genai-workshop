    "## Why \"Apple\" Queries Can Fail in Vector-Cypher Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "When you ask a question like \"What are the risks that Apple faces?\" using a vector-Cypher retriever, you may not get the structured or complete answer you expect. Here’s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How Vector-Cypher Works:**  \n",
    "  - The retrieval process first performs a semantic search over all text chunks in the graph.\n",
    "  - It retrieves the top-k chunks most similar to your query—regardless of which company (or entity) they are about.\n",
    "  - The Cypher query then starts from each chunk and traverses the graph for related information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Problem with Entity-Centric Queries:**  \n",
    "  - If your query is about \"Apple,\" but there are no chunks whose text is semantically similar to your query and also specifically about Apple, the retriever may return:\n",
    "    - Chunks about other companies.\n",
    "    - Chunks that mention \"risk\" but not \"Apple.\"\n",
    "    - Generic or boilerplate risk factor text.\n",
    "  - The Cypher query can only traverse from the retrieved chunk—it cannot \"filter\" or \"redirect\" to Apple if the chunk isn’t already about Apple.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Limitation:**  \n",
    "  - **The chunk is the anchor.** If your query is about an entity (like Apple), but the chunk retrieval is not entity-aware, you may never reach the correct node or context in the graph.\n",
    "  - This is especially problematic for broad or entity-centric questions, where you want to aggregate or summarize information about a specific node (e.g., a company) rather than just retrieve semantically similar passages.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Conclusion:**  \n",
    "> Vector-Cypher retrieval is powerful for finding relevant context, but it is fundamentally limited by the chunk-centric approach. For entity-centric questions, you need either:\n",
    "> - Chunks that are explicitly about the entity, or\n",
    "> - A retrieval/query strategy that starts from the entity node itself, not from arbitrary text chunks."

    "## VectorCypherRetriever Example: Detailed Search with Context — Why This Is a Good Query\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to use `VectorCypherRetriever` to answer nuanced, relationship-driven questions by combining semantic search with graph traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this is a good query:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semantic Relevance:**  \n",
    "  The vector retriever surfaces text chunks that are semantically similar to the question (\"Who are the asset managers most affected by banking regulations?\"). This grounds the search in passages that actually discuss asset managers and regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graph Contextualization:**  \n",
    "  The Cypher query starts from each relevant chunk and traverses the graph to:\n",
    "    - Find the source document.\n",
    "    - Identify the company associated with the document.\n",
    "    - Traverse to asset managers that own or are related to that company.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structured and Contextual Output:**  \n",
    "  The result provides:\n",
    "    - The company name (`company`)\n",
    "    - The asset manager’s name (`manager`)\n",
    "    - The text context from the original chunk (`context`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why it works well:**  \n",
    "  - The question is naturally chunk-centric: you want to find meaningful passages about asset managers and regulations, then extract structured information about the entities involved.\n",
    "  - The graph traversal enriches the answer, linking unstructured context (text) to structured graph entities (companies, managers).\n",
    "  - This approach leverages the best of both worlds: semantic search for relevance, and graph queries for structure and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**  \n",
    "This pattern is ideal when your question is about relationships or context that can be surfaced from relevant passages, and when you want to return both the context and the structured entities connected to it.  \n",
    "It is less effective for purely entity-centric aggregation (like \"all risks for Apple\"), but perfect for questions where the chunk is the natural anchor for graph exploration.\n"
